== This is the first version of my site.
I built it using RefineryCMS (Rails 3.2.16) and Zurb Foundation 5; I deployed it on Heroku's Cedar stack with Amazon S3 for media storage.

It was a fun experiment, but I'm replacing it with something a little more full-stack JS.

Thanks for checking out my code.
